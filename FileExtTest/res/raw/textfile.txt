I knew that it was love to keep someone
in my heart to the end, because of the meaning
I knew that my sore heart due to you
Was the pain of loving you,
When I was young.
Now I let you go from my heart
Good bye love, I leave you, who were in my heart
On the river flowing far away and in the far wind.
After an empty space in my heart at the age free from vacillation, 
I am past knowing what love is
Now I know that love is not to confine someone 
In my heart, but to wait for them with an open heart,
That is, to wait for someone to fill the empty space,
That love is to wait for someone
